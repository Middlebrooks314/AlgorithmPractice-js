// REACTO

// R - *Repeat* the question (make sure you understand the question)
// E - Give *examples* (given these parameters what output do you expect)
// A - Describe your *approaches* (help the interviewer understand the path and you can get a little feedback from interviewer's response)
// C - *Code*... psudocode from higher level (Breath first coding from CTCI Book),
// T - *Test* your code, Run some of the examples through the code, use another color to show the changing variables, show that you can find your own problems
// O - *Optimization* and run time, see if you can refactor **Big O**

//Extra tips - leave space to add and remove code because it isnt like a text editor, star things that you are not sure about


//Debugger 

function reverse(string) {
    debugger;
    return string.split('').reduce((rev, char) => char + rev, '');
}

reverse('asdf');

1. add debugger statement inside of the function
2. invoke the function 
3. cd into the directory of the problem 
4. in terminal run 'node inspect index.js'
5. debug> continue (c, cont) 
6. if you want to inspect variables you have to run  => debug> repl
