// REACTO

// R - *Repeat* the question (make sure you understand the question)
// E - Give *examples* (given these parameters what output do you expect)
// A - Describe your *approaches* (help the interviewer understand the path and you can get a little feedback from interviewer's response)
// C - *Code*... psudocode from higher level (Breath first coding from CTCI Book),
// T - *Test* your code, Run some of the examples through the code, use another color to show the changing variables, show that you can find your own problems
// O - *Optimization* and run time, see if you can refactor **Big O**

//Extra tips - leave space to add and remove code because it isnt like a text editor, star things that you are not sure about
